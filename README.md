This repository contains code for Porwal-Raftery-PNAS-2022 paper titled "Comparing Methods for Statistical Inference with Model
Uncertainty". The code is minimal working code to perform the analysis and summarize the results. The code has not been thoroughly commented since it is self explanatory. In case of questions, please contact the authors (using github/email) for further clarifications. Link to raw results per dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uVQ-2v1lARvpzpWkcmyVpItAYA92NkmY?usp=sharing)
